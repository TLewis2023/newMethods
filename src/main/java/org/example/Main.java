 /*Question 8:
         Using the Scanner class. Prompt a user for their name
        - If their name is Aliyah or Hakeem. Print out "Hello Aliyah" or "Hello Hakeem"
        - If the user's name is not Aliyah or Hakeem then keep asking for their name
        - Note: a user may type the letters of their name in uppercase or lowercase
        eg: aLiYah, aLIYah or HakEEm, hAkEeM. Your code should work regardless
